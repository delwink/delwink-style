Delwink Style
=============

This repository contains documentation for Delwink's coding conventions. The
Makefile contains build instructions for all compiled language examples.

Standards
---------

C code should be restricted to no later a standard than C99, and Makefiles
should be POSIX-compliant. On GNU systems, use bmake (NetBSD make) to test
Makefile compatibility.

Shell scripts should be strictly Bourne-compatible, using `#!/bin/sh` at the
top of the file. Use tabs for indentation, and don't go over 80 columns.

Goal
----

Delwink strives for cross-compatibility of its software. In compiled languages
especially, strict adherence to cross-platform standards is key. In addition to
compatibility of software, we want compatibility between environments as
well. Our code conventions aim to make it easier to edit source with any editor
without relying on extensions.

Errors
------

If you notice a compatibility error, please report it (preferably with a
solution) to Delwink so that we may update it immediately.
